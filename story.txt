bob have a dream that one day he can eat burger without getting catch up on his
white shirt. Bob is a zombie who like KFC. 
Zombie Bob's favorite burger restaurant is Culver's; more specifically, he loves the double butter burgers from there.
Whenevever zombie bob goes to culvers, it makes his stomach hurt Yes!

Hmm....but can you guess what my favorite burger from culver's is?
major twist, bob is a vagee.

Unaware of the definition of "vagee," co-author Isaac searched it on google.
Needless to say, he was surprised lol, he believes that "vagee" was accidentally used in place of "vegan."
